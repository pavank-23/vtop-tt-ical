### Quick Guide
---
#### To run the script, start by installing the following requirement:

```
pip install icalendar
```

#### You can generate an .ical file, by copying the contents from the time table page of VTOP to a .csv file and running the script by providing the file name like so:

```
python ical.py [input_file]
```

#### Now you end up with an .ical file in the same directory which can be imported into any calendar application (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.)
